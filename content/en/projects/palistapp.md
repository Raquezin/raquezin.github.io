A platform for tracking results, races, and competitors in Spanish canoeing/kayaking events.

**Status:** Active development (since May 2024) · [palistapp.com](https://www.palistapp.com)

## What it is

PalistApp centralizes Spanish canoeing data: competition results, athlete profiles, and race calendars. Before PalistApp, this information was scattered and hard to access.

## Tech stack

- **Data:** Scraping + manual cleaning and validation
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Backend:** Go API (low latency)
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript + Vite

## Numbers

- ~100,000 requests processed in 4 days
